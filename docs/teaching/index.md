# Teaching Resources and Course Evaluations

General resources for teaching and other fun stuff.

## Course Evaluations

Evaluations of courses that I have taught. I do try to include all courses that
I have taught, but some may be missing if they may identify students or other
instructors. Every semester I read through the evaluations and try to improve my
teaching based on the feedback. I would like to thank all of my students for
taking the time to fill out the evaluations. I do take the feedback seriously!
