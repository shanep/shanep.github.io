  introduces and evaluates full stack web development.
- [Project 5](https://github.com/shanep/cs208-p5-starter) - This project will be
  group based and allow you to practice not only your web development skills but
  also use git and GitHub in a team based environment. All grades are given
  **individually** so even though you will work in a group you will grade will
  not be impacted by any team members lack of effort or contributions.
