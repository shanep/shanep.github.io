# JavaScript Introduction

In this Module, we will introduce the JavaScript programming language.
JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the
world. JavaScript is supported by every major web browser and makes web
applications like Gmail and Google Maps possible. JavaScript is also
popular outside the web browser for creating server-side web
applications (Ex: Node.js, which runs JavaScript). While JavaScript is a
fairly easy language to pick up if you already know another language
such as Java or C# there are enough gotchas to warrant reviewing the
language in depth.

This module will take an estimated 15 - 18 hours to complete.
