## Retrospective

Each programming project contains a file name Retrospective.md. While I really
don’t like having hard word counts I have found that if I don’t specify a
minimum **some** students will take advantage of that and submit nothing of
substance. The Retrospective is important for me as it gives some insight into
your learning process and helps me understand where you may be struggling. Thus,
it is expected that the **Experience** section is at least 200 words long.
Points will be deducted based on how far below the required word count you are.
Additionally, up to 50% of your score for this section can be deducted if filler
sentences are used to artificially inflate the word count.

Having trouble figuring out what to write? Here are some questions to get you
started.

- How did you test your project? Were you able to rely on automated tests or
  did you have to manually test your code?
- Were there any things that you struggled with?
- Were there any parts of this lab that were unclear or poorly specified?
- Were you able to get the entire project done?
- Detail one new thing you learned.
- Anything else you would like to share is awesome and encouraged 😃.

If the assignments ask you to include any graphs, screenshots or other artifacts
as they must display correctly when viewed on github. You can reference the
[markdown](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#images)
help docs for how to include images.

For the **Known issues or Bugs** section you need to detail any issues or bugs
that you have in your code. For example maybe your code crashes randomly and you
couldn’t figure out why. If your code doesn’t have any issues you can simply
write NONE in this section.

For the **Sources used section** you must detail any sources you used outside of
the textbook or course website. If you write NONE in this section it is assumed
that you didn’t use google at all. Be safe CITE! Remember that using ChatGPT,
Google Bard, or any other AI generated text is considered a source and must be
listed here.
