# Project 0

![P0 Meme](images/p0-meme.jpeg)

This assignment is intended to serve as an introduction to the build tools that
you will be using this semester. This project demonstrates the only
**officially** supported tools and programming languages supported. If you feel
ambitions you can create your own template using what ever programming language
and set of tools that you like. However, be aware that some assignments require
you to deal with raw (untyped) memory which languages like python can’t do
without diving down into C.

If you want to use a language like [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
you must create your own starter code template that works with the class
grading framework and have it approved by the instructor. Choosing an
unsupported language qualifies you for bonus points on the every
project. So you will have to decide if the risk is worth the reward 😃.

## Learning Outcomes

- 5.4 Explore compiling and running code on at least 2 different systems
- 5.5 Explore how to setup a continuous integration and testing project

## ✅ Instructor support systems

Your instructor and GA/TA will support the Kount Lab, Onyx and GitHub
codespaces. If you are working in the lab follow the instructions in the
[CS Lab](https://github.com/shanep/cpp-project-template/blob/master/README-KOUNT-LAB.md)
document. Otherwise you can use [GitHub Codespaces](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/getting-started/quickstart)
to work on your projects.

## VSCode Notes

The VSCode CMake extension (2023-10-17) does not support all the
features of cmake presets that this project uses so you will need to add
the following to your settings.json file so that the extension does not
complain about the new features we are
using.`"cmake.allowUnsupportedPresetsVersions": true`.

## Tools

In order to work on all the projects this semester you have several
options. I have listed all the different options that you can use this
semester.

1. Use [Github Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)
2. Install Linux in a Virtual Machine
3. Come in and use the Lab machines directly
4. Code remotely using ssh!

## Native Programming

- Java is cross platform
- This class is not!
- You will be calling system calls directly
- We will be using Linux

## Virtual Machine

One of the biggest barriers to getting started is to get all your tools
installed and configured correctly. While it is certainly possible to
develop on any platform (Windows, OSX, BSD, etc.), developing on Linux
is by far the quickest and easiest method. Thus, if you want to jump
right in and start writing code without getting all your tools
configured and your development machine is not running Linux you can
start developing in a Virtual machine. Once you get some experience with
the tools and process you should be able to setup any machine to do OS
development on.

## Building 🏛

- Your project must build from the command line
- Your project must build on onyx
  - Failure to compile on either will result in a 0! 💀

## Memory Tools

We will look at a few open source tools that you can use to help track
down and solve memory errors in C and C++. Due to the unsafe nature of
these languages we need to be extra careful not to let latent memory
bugs creep into our code. Luckily, there have been lots of tools
developed over the years that can help us track down these errors.

While it may be tempting to just eschew C and C++ for a more modern
language that has reduced or eliminated these types of errors, that may
not always be practical because of your working domain. For example,
some micro controllers may have an instruction set architecture (ISA)
that a newer language such as Rust can’t even generate code for, so your
ony choice is to use the software development kit (SDK) that is provided
by the manufacturer which is most certainly written in C!

Finally, even if everyone in the world stopped creating any **new**
projects in C and C++ there are still **billions** of lines of existing
C and C++ code that can’t be replaced overnight. So the need to
maintain, update, and port existing C and C++ code bases will remain an
active area of development for the forseeable future.

## Address sanitizer

According to the LLVM documentation [Address Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html) is a fast
memory error detector. It consists of a compiler instrumentation module
and a run-time library. Address sanitizer should
[not be used in production](https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2016/02/17/9),
it is a development tool to help the engineer track down memory issues
when developing code or tracking down elusive bugs.

One of the best uses of address sanitizer is to use it while unit
testing your code to make sure and catch any low hanging fruit. The tool
can detect the following types of bugs:

- Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and globals
- Use-after-free
- Use-after-return (clang flag
    -fsanitize-address-use-after-return=(never|runtime|always) default:
    runtime)
- Enable runtime with:
    ASAN\_OPTIONS=detect\_stack\_use\_after\_return=1
- Use-after-scope (clang flag -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope)
- Double-free, invalid free
- Memory leaks (experimental and currently only on linux)

Here is an example of using address sanitizer (from the llvm docs):

```c
% cat example_UseAfterFree.cc
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  int *array = new int[100];
  delete [] array;
  return array[argc];  // BOOM
}
```

Compile and link:

`% clang++ -O1 -g -fsanitize=address -fno-omit-frame-pointer example_UseAfterFree.cc`

## Valgrind

[Valgrind](https://valgrind.org/) is an awesome tool that can detect
[most, but not all](https://github.com/google/sanitizers/wiki/AddressSanitizerComparisonOfMemoryTools),
of the same type of errors that Address Sanitizer can. The biggest
difference is Valgrind doesn’t have to be compiled into your binary, so
if you don’t have the source code to a particular component you can
still debug issues with Valgrind. Valgrind acts as a virtual machine
that dynamically recompile's the code during runtime. This adds
considerable overhead to your program and can slow down execution by as
much as 20x. While Valgrind can’t detect all errors it can help you
track down read/write errors and memory leaks without having to
recompile your executable. This is nice if you have a nasty bug that
only shows up in a release build but disappears in debug builds.

You should not use Valgrind on executables that are already compiled
with address sanitizer. You will not get *better* detection it will just
slow down your code even more and make your life more difficult. A good
approach is to use Address Sanitizer on debug builds and Valgrind on
release builds where address sanitizer has been disabled.

After you run your program Valgrind will report any leaks or errors
after your program exits.

```bash
All heap blocks were freed -- no leaks are possible
ERROR SUMMARY: 0 errors from 0 contexts (suppressed: 0 from 0)
```

Anything else in the valgrind output indicates that you have an error
and it must be fixed no matter how minor.

## Avoid shooting yourself in the foot

One of the easiest ways to prevent memory related errors is to just
avoid (to the greatest extent possible) some of the more dangerous and
poorly designed parts of C and the C standard library. Remember that C
was invented in a simpler time and was a vast improvement over writing
raw assembly at the time. So while some things may seem obvious now,
remember we have the advantage of hindsight!

In the last 40+ years much has been learned about writing secure code
and we should take advantage of those lessons learned. While it would be
great to just remove all the legacy cruft and start new, there is simply
too much code in the world that still depends on some unsafe and poorly
designed API’s. So while we can’t remove the old cruft, we can still
avoid using anything dangerous in any **new** code that is written.

## Cross Platform Development

While the project is configured to download and install some of the required
dependencies each operating system still needs to have some tools installed to
proceed. The following sections will help you install the required dependencies
for each operating system. Every Semester new issues pop up because of software
upgrades and other changes that are outside of your instructors control so if
you encounter any errors please let your instructor know what you did to fix the
problem so this section can be updated for other students 😃.

The systems listed below have been tested by your instructor to work at
one point in time. However, due to the high number of permutations that
students personal systems can come in all systems listed below are **not
supported**. If you can not get your personal system to work then you
will need to work in either codespaces or in the CS Lab.

## Conditional Compilation

Take a look at the provided `src/lab.cpp` and notice the code that looks
similar to what is show below. This is called a pre-processor directive
and allows you to change what code is compiled based on the the
operating system you are targeting. If you want to create a process on
linux you would call
[fork](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html) - [exec](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html).
on windows you would need to call [Create
Process](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/procthread/creating-processes).
Pre-processor directives allow you to have code that supports both
operating systems in the same file which can help reduce overall code
maintenance at the system level.

As an example:

```c
#ifdef __linux__
    //linux code goes here
#leif _WIN32
    // windows code goes here
#else
#endif
```

## ❌ Untested Systems

The following systems have been deprecated and are no longer tested or
supported. If you are running one of the systems below you should
upgrade to a more recent system.

- Windows 10
- Ubuntu 20.04

## Task 1 - Fix Issues

You need to fix all the issues in the project template. There should be
not build warnings, not disabled tests, and everything should pass.

## Task 2 - Code coverage

Add enough tests beyond what the professor has given you to get to 100%
code coverage. You are not expected to have 100% code coverage for all
your projects (see the grading rubric) but for this simple intro it is
trivial to get to 100%.
