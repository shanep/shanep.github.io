# Project 3

![P3 Meme](./images/p3-meme.png)

## Overview

In this project, we will be implementing a simple shell that can start
background process using the examples that were presented in chapter 5.

## Learning Outcomes

- 1.2 Use system library code
- 1.3 Use system documentation
- 1.4 Apply computer science theory and software development fundamentals to
    produce computing-based solutions. **(ABET Outcome 6)**
- 2.2 Explore the system call interface

<!--@include: ../../../parts/project-setup-boiler.md -->

## Task 2 - Prepare your repository

The starter repository is a bare bones template that you will need to update with the starter code
below.

### app/main.c

<<<@/code/452/p3/main.c

### src/lab.h

<<< @/code/452/p3/lab.h{c}

### src/lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p3/lab.c

### tests/test-lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p3/test-lab.c

Once you have updated all the starter code lets make your first commit so everything is saved. Open
up a terminal and lets make a commit!

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Added in starter code"
```

## Task 3 - Print Version

Let’s start off simple and just have our shell print off its version.
When the shell is started with a command line argument -v, it prints out
the version of the project and then quits, you will need to leverage the
header file `lab.h` for the major and minor version. Parse the
command line arguments with
[getop](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Example-of-Getopt.html).
The program should exit after printing the version.

## Task 4 - User Input

While we could use a function like
[scanf](https://cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/scanf/) to get input from
the user a much more robust way would be to leverage the [GNU Readline
library](https://tiswww.case.edu/php/chet/readline/rltop.html). The GNU
Readline library allows a program to control the input line and adds a
bunch of cool functions that allow the user to edit the line, use TAB
key for filename completion, and the use of up arrow, down arrow, left
arrow and right arrow keys to access the history of commands typed in by
the user. You will need to include the header files
`readline/readline.h` and `readline/history.h` to use the readline
functions.

```c
#include <readline/readline.h>
#include <readline/history.h>
char *line;
using_history();
while ((line=readline("$"))){
    printf("%s\n",line);
    add_history(line);
    free(line);
}
```

You need to install both the readline header files and development
libraries for the above code to compile and link. All the correct
libraries are installed on the lab machines. On Redhat based machines
development packages end in devel. So to get all the readline
development packages you would need to install **readline-devel** as
well as **readline**. On ubuntu the development files are named
**readline-dev**.

The readline documentation is a good starting point on how to use the
readline library. Pay close attention to memory ownership. Remember that
C does not have a garbage collector.

- [Readline Docs](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/readline.html)
- [History Docs](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/history.html)

## Task 5 - Custom Prompt

The default prompt for the shell may be anything you like. However the
shell checks for an environment variable `MY_PROMPT`. If the environment
variable is set, then it uses the value as the prompt. The environment
variable can be set inline `MY_PROMPT="foo>" ./myprogram` so you can
quickly test your program.

- Use the system call
    [getenv](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html) to
    retrieve environment variables

## Task 6 - Built in Commands

Now that we can get input from users lets add in some built in commands.
These commands need to be handled by the shell itself, you should not
create a new process to handle these commands so it is good to implement
these **before** you add in the fork/exec code in a future task.

### Exit command

Include a built-in command named `exit` that terminates the shell
normally. Your shell should return a status of 0 when it terminates
normally and a non-zero status otherwise. Your shell should also
terminate normally on receiving the end of input
[EOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End-of-file) (Under Linux and bash,
this would normally be Ctl-d for you to test your mini-shell). You are
required to clean up any allocated memory before you exit.

- [exit](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exit.3.html)

### Change Directory Command

Include a built-in command named `cd` to allow an user to change
directories. You will need to use the `chdir` system call. The `cd`
command without any arguments should change the working directory to the
user’s home directory. You must first use `getenv` and if `getenv`
returns NULL your program should fall back to the system calls `getuid`
and `getpwuid` to find out the home directory of the user. Make sure to
print an error message if the cd command fails.

- See [chdir](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/chdir.2.html)
- See [getenv](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getenv.3.html)
- See [getuid](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/getuid.2.html)
- See [getpwuid](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/getpwuid.3p.html)

### History Command

Add a new built in command to your shell to print out a history of
command entered. You should leverage the [history
library](https://tiswww.cwru.edu/php/chet/readline/history.html) library
to accomplish this.

## Task 7 - Create a Process

Our shell will create a new process and wait for it to complete. The
shell accepts one command per line with arguments. It should accept at
least `ARG_MAX` arguments to any command. You will need to use the
system call `sysconf` and `_SC_ARG_MAX` to get the maximum length of
arguments that the the `exec` family of functions can accept. The shell
will parse each line that is entered and then attempt to execute the
process using the `execvp` system call. The `execvp` system call
performs a search for the command using the `PATH` environment variable.
This will simplify your programming since you do not have to search for
the location of the command.

For our simple shell you can assume that all command line arguments will
be separated by spaces, you don’t have to worry about quoted arguments.
For example given the command `ls -l -a` you would parse this string as
an array of size 3 with the structure of `ls` → `-l` → and `-a`. The
command `ls "-l -a"` would parse out to be `ls` → `"-l` → `-a"`. If you
want to write a parsing algorithm that handles quotes like bash more
information is available at [the linux documentation
project](https://tldp.org/LDP/Bash-Beginners-Guide/html/sect_03_03.html).

If the user just presses the Enter key, then the shell displays another
prompt. If the user types just spaces and then presses the Enter key,
then the shell displays another prompt as this is also an empty command.
Empty commands should not cause a segfault or memory leak.

- [execvp](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/exec.3.html)
- [fork()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/fork.2.html)
- [waitpid()](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/wait.2.html)

## Task 8 - Signals

The shell should ignore the signals listed below:

```c
signal(SIGINT, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGQUIT, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGTSTP, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGTTIN, SIG_IGN);
signal(SIGTTOU, SIG_IGN);
```

In the child process don’t forget to set these signals back to default!

```c
/*This is the child process*/
pid_t child = getpid();
setpgid(child, child);
tcsetpgrp(sh.shell_terminal,child);
signal (SIGINT, SIG_DFL);
signal (SIGQUIT, SIG_DFL);
signal (SIGTSTP, SIG_DFL);
signal (SIGTTIN, SIG_DFL);
signal (SIGTTOU, SIG_DFL);
execvp(cmd[0], cmd);
fprintf(stderr, "exec failed\n");
```

If there is no process being executed, then the shell should just
display a new prompt and ignore any input on the current line. You will
need to use the tcgetpgrp and tcsetpgrp system calls to get and set the
foreground process group of the controlling terminal and the signal
system call to ignore and enable signals.

The glibc manual links below describe a full job control shell. You are
not required to implement a job control shell to the same level of
functionality. You can to use the documentation linked below as a guide
but be aware you shell will probably fail to function correctly if you
just copy and paste the code examples without understanding what they
do. You are free to use code from the manual as long as you take the
time to understand what it does and why.

- [glibc - Initializing the Shell](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Initializing-the-Shell.html)
- [glibc - Launching Jobs](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Launching-Jobs.html)
- [Signal man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/signal.7.html)

## Task 9 - Background Processes

Your shell can start a process in the background if an ampersand(&) is
the last character on the line. For each background process that is
started, it prints an id and the process id (pid) of the background
process and the full command that was given by the user. After starting
a background process, the shell comes back with a prompt ready to accept
a new command from the user without waiting for the background process
to finish. The user should not be required to separate the & from the
command by a space. For example, the commands date & and date& are both
valid. Additionally, blanks after the ampersand are valid as well.

The mini shell should keep track of process running in the background.
Whenever the user starts a process in the background, it should assign
and display the job number, the associated process id and the full
command (including the ampersand).

`[n] process-id command`

It should also display an informative message when a background job is
done. That is, every time the user presses the ENTER key, the shell
should report all the background processes that have finished since the
last time the user pressed the ENTER key. The message should be of the
following form:

`[n] Done command`

Where n is the job number and command is the actual command that was
typed. You should use the WNOHANG option with the waitpid system call to
determine the status of background processes.

## Task 10 - Jobs command

Add a new built-in command called jobs, that prints out all the
background commands that are running or are done but whose status has
not yet been reported. Here is a sample output:

```bash
[1] 3451 Running sleep 100 &
[2] Done    sleep 5 &
[3] 3452 Running gargantuan &
```

The first job should be assigned the job number 1. Each additional job
should be assigned one higher number. If lower numbered jobs finish,
then we do not reuse them unless all jobs numbered higher than that
number have also finished.

## Additional Resources

Below are some links to some awesome documentation for writing a job
control shell which you should read through before you start coding as
it will help you understand the problem space. However, be aware that
the libc manual describes a much more complex shell than what we are
building so don’t panic if you don’t understand everything in the
manual.

Keep in mind that some of the code samples provided in the libc manual
are written in C89 so may look a bit strange if you are used to only
reading C99 code.
