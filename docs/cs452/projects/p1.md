# Project 1

![P1 Meme](images/p1-meme.jpeg)

## Overview

This project is intended to serve as an introduction to the project template,
build tools, and process to complete projects during this semester. This project
demonstrates the only **officially** supported tools and programming languages.

We are going to review the following topics:

1. How to setup your project with the provided starter code
2. How to use the build system
3. How to write unit tests
4. Demonstrate address sanitizer output
5. How to use the debugger
6. Submitting the project over email

## Learning Outcomes

- 5.1 Compile your code with a build system
- 5.2 Use a professional unit test framework  (win32, posix)
- 5.3 Use a professional version control system (git)
- 5.4 Explore compiling and running code on at least 2 different systems (Codespaces and the CS Lab)
- 5.5 Explore how to setup a continuous integration and testing project

## Task 2 - Prepare your repository

The starter repository is a bare bones template that you will need to update with the starter code
below.

### src/lab.h

<<< @/code/452/p1/lab.h{c}

### src/lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p1/lab.c

### app/main.c

<<< @/code/452/p1/main.c

### tests/test-lab.c

<<< @/code/452/p1/test-lab.c

Once you have updated all the starter code lets make your first commit so everything is saved. Open
up a terminal and lets make a commit!

```bash
git add --all
git commit -m "Added in starter code"
```

Here is what it should look like.

```bash
$ git add --all
$ git commit -m "Added in starter code"

## Task 3 - Compile

You can compile the project by typing `make` in the terminal.  Once you have successfully compiled
the project you can run the executable like this:


```bash
@BSU-ShanePanter ➜ /workspaces/cs452-p1 (master) $ make
mkdir -p build/src/
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP -c src/lab.c -o build/src/lab.c.o
mkdir -p build/app/
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP -c app/main.c -o build/app/main.c.o
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP build/src/lab.c.o build/app/main.c.o -o myprogram -pthread -lreadline
mkdir -p build/tests/harness/
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP -c tests/harness/unity.c -o build/tests/harness/unity.c.o
mkdir -p build/tests/
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP -c tests/test-lab.c -o build/tests/test-lab.c.o
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP build/src/lab.c.o build/tests/harness/unity.c.o build/tests/test-lab.c.o  -o test-lab -pthread -lreadline

```

Well that is not good! We have a memory leak in the starter code that we need to fix. Open up the
file `app/main.c` and free the `line` and `version` variables after the printf call.

```c
free(line);
free(version);
```

Now compile and run the program again to see the fix.

```bash
@BSU-ShanePanter ➜ /workspaces/cs452-p1 (master) $ make
mkdir -p build/app/
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP -c app/main.c -o build/app/main.c.o
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP build/src/lab.c.o build/app/main.c.o -o myprogram -pthread -lreadline
@BSU-ShanePanter ➜ /workspaces/cs452-p1 (master) $ ./myprogram
What is your name?shane
Hello shane! This is the starter template version: 1.0
```

Lets commit our work so far.

```bash
git add app/main.c
git commit -m "Fixed leak in main.c"
git push

```

So far so good. We now have a working executable that is bug free. Lets move on to the tests.

## Task 4 - Test

The starter template is setup with a testing harness that will make it easy to write and run
tests. You can compile all the tests and then run them by typing `make check`. The project template
is setup to compile your code with [Address
Sanitizer](https://clang.llvm.org/docs/AddressSanitizer.html). This approach will allow us to write
high quality code and catch bugs early so when we are working on larger projects we can focus on the
project requirements instead of the low level details of memory errors. Address sanitizer can detect
the following types of bugs:

- Out-of-bounds accesses to heap, stack and globals
- Use-after-free
- Use-after-return (clang flag
    -fsanitize-address-use-after-return=(never|runtime|always) default:
    runtime)
- Enable runtime with:
    ASAN\_OPTIONS=detect\_stack\_use\_after\_return=1
- Use-after-scope (clang flag -fsanitize-address-use-after-scope)
- Double-free, invalid free
- Memory leaks (experimental and currently only on linux)

You should see a bunch of tests fail.  You need to fix all the issues in the
project before proceeding to the next task. There should be no build warnings,
no disabled tests, and everything should pass.

::: info

This is just a warm-up project. The functions that are failing can be fixed in any number of ways. I
am not looking for any specific fix, I am just looking for you to make the tests pass instead.

:::

Fix all the tests in the file `tests/test-lab.c` to pass just like we did in the previous step. Once
you have all the tests passing make sure and do a `git add`, `git commit` and `git push` just
like the previous task.

Once you have fixed all the broken tests you should see a clean test run will all tests passing.

```bash
@BSU-ShanePanter ➜ /workspaces/cs452-p1 (master) $ make check
mkdir -p build/tests/
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP -c tests/test-lab.c -o build/tests/test-lab.c.o
cc -Wall -Wextra -fno-omit-frame-pointer -fsanitize=address -g -MMD -MP build/src/lab.c.o build/tests/harness/unity.c.o build/tests/test-lab.c.o  -o test-lab -pthread -lreadline
ASAN_OPTIONS=detect_leaks=1 ./test-lab
tests/test-lab.c:29:test_leak:PASS
tests/test-lab.c:30:test_segfault:PASS
tests/test-lab.c:31:test_bounds:PASS

-----------------------
3 Tests 0 Failures 0 Ignored
OK
```

## Task 5 - Run the debugger

This starter template should work out of the box for both unit tests and the executable. Open the
debugger view in VSCode and set a breakpoint in the `main` function and a breakpoint in one of the
functions in the `tests/test-lab.c file`.  Run the debugger and verify that the debugger stops at
the breakpoints. You will need to run the debugger separately for the unit tests and the executable.

::: danger

While this task is not graded it is important that you are able to use the
debugger, so don't skip this task. Make sure you can use the debugger **now**
instead of at 11:45pm the night the project is due and there is no one around to
help you.
