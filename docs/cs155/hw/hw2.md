# HW2 - Create a Patch

In this homework you will learn how to use git to create a patch that can be emailed to another
developer. This method of development is how git was originally designed to work and is still widely
used by massive projects like the [Linux
Kernel](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/process/submitting-patches.html).  It may take a few
attempts to get everything correct but once you are able to wrap your head around the process you
will have unlocked a powerful software development skill!
