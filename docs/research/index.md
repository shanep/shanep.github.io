# Software Engineering Research

## Conferences

A list of conferences in the field of software engineering. Conferences are
ranked by the [CORE ranking](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) and are
either A*, A, B, or C. Every conference has a different focus, so it is
important to read the call for papers to see if your research fits the
conference. Delft University of Technology has developed and maintains a website
called [conf.researchr.org](https://conf.researchr.org/) that a lot of conferences
use to manage their conferences.
