## Conferences

A list of conferences in the field of software engineering. Conferences are
ranked by the [CORE ranking](http://portal.core.edu.au/conf-ranks/) and are
either A*, A, B, or C. Every conference has a different focus, so it is
important to read the call for papers to see if your research fits the
conference. Delft University of Technology has developed and maintains a website
called [conf.researchr.org](https://conf.researchr.org/) that a lot of conferences
use to manage their conferences.

## Journals

Journal impact factors vary significantly by discipline, making cross-field
comparisons inappropriate. Citation behaviors and perceptions of what
constitutes "high-impact" research differ markedly across academic fields. For
instance, life sciences journals typically exhibit higher impact factors owing
to larger researcher populations and more frequent citation practices.
Conversely, disciplines within the humanities and social sciences often report
lower impact factors but place greater emphasis on the enduring relevance and
longevity of published research.
